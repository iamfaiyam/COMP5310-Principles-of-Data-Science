    "Try changing the number of bins and observe how the plot changes. The higher the number of bins, the smaller the bars will become, as it will divide the data in more segments. If you know the _min_ and _max_ of your data values, you can calculate an appropiate number of bins depending of what you want to observe. For example, if your data values go from 1 to 100, if you select 10 bins, it will divide your data in segments of every 10: 1-10, 11-20, ... , 91-100. If you select 5 bins, it will divide your data in segments of every 5: 1-5, 6-10, ... , 96-100. Always choose a number of bins that allows you to observe the tendency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's make a histogram with some nominal data. To do this, we first need to obtain the frequency distribution for the data we want to plot (See Exercise 2), and then use a bar plot to visualise the distribution. In this case, we don't need to use the histogram function, and there's no bin size because we're not dealing with numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make the bar plot for the question _Which of the following best describes your industry?_ Given that our data has nominal data, it's best to make a horizontal bar plot. Additionally, we can use the pandas function `plot.barh()` to plot the data. This way, we only need to obtain the frequency distribution of the data and then plot. We can set the title of the plot as an option and then we can specify the labels of the axis using the `set_xlabel()` and `set_ylabel` functions."
